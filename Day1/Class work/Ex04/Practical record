Practical No: 04
Problem Specification:Arithmetic Operations in Java
Implementation:
class Ex04{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		int x=10;
		int y=2;
		
		System.out.println("Addition is : "+(x+y));
		System.out.println("Substraction is : "+(x-y));
		System.out.println("Multiplication is : "+(x*y));
		System.out.println("Division is : "+(x/y));
		System.out.println("Modulus is : "+(x%y));
		
	}
}
Output:
Addition is : 12  
Subtraction is : 8  
Multiplication is : 20  
Division is : 5  
Modulus is : 0

Conclusion: Learned about how use arithmatic operators in java
